# MFCC Extraction 
A much simpler version of mfcc extraction. Referenced from http://kaldi-asr.org and Jes√∫s Villalba <jesus.antonio.villalba@gmail.com>

Steps to extract mfcc features from audios. More like a future reference for myself.

## Explanation of what each file does: 
1. Every file is written in bash (shell script).  
2. conf/mfcc.conf is the mfcc configuration file. Change the sampling frequency according to the audio file. e.g. All the audio files are sampled at 8k, then set --sample-frequency=8000. One can also change the low-freq and high-freq setting to the desired bandwith. e.g. Telephone data has narrowband 300 and 3700, hence set --low-freq=300 and --high-freq=3700. 
3. cmd.sh is to submit job on the server (to my understanding). It is related to distrbuted computing and it is important to not drain the memory of a single machine. 
4. path.sh is to set the environment variable. Generally, one only needs to reset the kaldi path "export KALDI_ROOT=" to where one's original kaldi directory resides. I usually create a symbolic link at the previous directory with command ln -s `directory path` 'filename', and set the kaldi path to it.  
5. steps/make_mfcc.sh uses steps/ and utils/ directories to perform mfcc extraction. Go to line 60, the command scp=$data/wav.scp. Make sure your scp file in the train directory agrees. e.g. if the scp file is called beautiful_shit_wav.scp, then change the command to scp=$data/beautiful_shit_wav.scp
6. train/ directory contains: 
	a. wav.scp contains tuples of wav file key and location of the wav file  
	b. utt2spk contains tuples of wav file key and their respective labels 

## To run, follow the procedure: 
1. First and foremost, create a symbolic link to Jesus directory: ln -s `jesus directory path` 'jesus directory name' 
2. Create train/directory. Then, create the wav.scp (and utt2spk) file inside the train directory:
	a. Convert audio file to .wav format. Reference the script convert_to_wav.sh 
	sox ...
	b. Reference the script new_flac_to_wav.sh or gen_wav_scp.sh and an example of the train/ directory.
3. ./run.sh (if permission denied, do chmod u+x run.sh). This should create a mfcc directory and store the raw_mfcc_train.#.scp files. And store everything in mfcc_cmvn.h5
	a. mfccdir=`pwd`/mfcc_1 set the directory to store the extracted mfcc. e.g. specifying mfccdir=`pwd`/beautiful/shit/mfcc/ will store the extracted mfcc at /beautiful/shit/mfcc/
	b. steps/make_mfcc.sh --mfcc-config conf/mfcc.conf --nj 40 --cmd "$train_cmd" `pwd`/train log/mfcc_log $mfccdir 
		I. This function creates the extracted mfcc in binary files. 
		II. conf/mfcc.conf is where our mfcc configuration file locates at 
		III. `pwd`/train is where our train directory locates at 
		IV. log/mfcc_log is where the script will store the log files. It is helpful for debugging.
